      <h2>A Word from the Team</h2>
      <p>Hey folks ðŸ˜„. We&#39;re glad you&#39;re here.</p>
      <p>
        Nexus&#39; sole and only purpose is to provide a space where students
        can contribute and learn from other students&#39; experiences. We hope
        that you share the same sentiment as we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, we want to stress that we are here for a good time and
        do not want to promote any harrassment or flaming of any individual or
        group of people regardless of position.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where you can
        enjoy the super clean animations and great color theme (and dark mode
        âœ¨).
      </p>
      <p>
